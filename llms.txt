# Edith Mina Lyre

> Personal literary website of Edith Mina Lyre — writer, researcher, and PhD candidate at Monash University. The site hosts short fiction, poetry, and essays spanning critical theory, trans studies, schizoanalysis, speculative fiction, and myth. Edith also writes under the name Elm Alee.

Edith’s PhD thesis, *False Cows: Reports of a Trans Imaginary*, explores trans contributions to speculative fiction through fictocritical methodology. Her MPhil thesis, *Numbers by Paint: Quantifying Aesthetic Receptions* (Adelaide University, 2021), proposed fictoanalysis as a critical-creative method. Her essay “President Oedipus, or The Democratisation of Schizophrenia” was published by Overland in 2020.

The site is static HTML/CSS hosted at edithminalyre.com. Content is organised into stories, essays, and poems. Several stories are set in “Faerieland,” a secondary world populated by Aos sí and Aufgaolaí (descendants of fae-stolen children).
