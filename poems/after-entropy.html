                <span class="line">Like shadows, the slime of the hour collects,</span>
                <span class="line">Enwrapping your projects and designs —</span>
                <span class="line">Calling you to this, and to that,</span>
                <span class="line">The gradual rip away of you,</span>
                <span class="line">Each last bit — and that's what happens</span>
                <span class="line">With good causes — or good enough —</span>
                <span class="line">And living for them.</span>
            </div>
                <span class="line">Oblivion's the dream. Sacrifice and right action</span>
                <span class="line">Then coast: a pace as smooth as that which the moon kept with your childhood car.</span>
                <span class="line">But the stickiness and scum gather,</span>
                <span class="line">Spilling almost instantly over, though</span>
                <span class="line">Across your clouded sight, they ooze like decades.</span>
                <span class="line">Sleep will come, at least trust that,</span>
                <span class="line">And it will swallow the interjector.</span>
                <span class="line">The interjector: 'Experiment with forgetting you set your alarm,</span>
                <span class="line">'Experiment with letting tomorrow go,</span>
                <span class="line">'Experiment with an endless tomorrow and think:</span>
                <span class="line">'Here's the end of things and here comes the dull drift of peace,</span>
                <span class="line">'And on the doldrums of tomorrow we'll — just — linger.'</span>
                <span class="line">You won't believe the things the interjector will do to you.</span>
                <span class="line">You won't believe how much you'll like it.</span>
                <span class="line">Isn't evil evil, so banal, the digestive catastrophes of</span>
                <span class="line">Well doneness and gristle, a program that'll</span>
                <span class="line">Bluescreen the subject's humanity? By definition:</span>
                <span class="line">Not to do. Aren't you otherwise – you ingenious, ticking cyborgs –</span>
                <span class="line">Tending too automatic, shedding your special ascendancy,</span>
                <span class="line">Your connection to— oh, to what?</span>
                <span class="line">Anyway, it's wrong, sleep will come, it will swallow it.</span>
                <span class="line">'We know what breaking is. Shells break, like all things,</span>
                <span class="line">'And then shells don't exist and never did, nor eggs,</span>
                <span class="line">'Nor the globe of the sun.'</span>
                <span class="line">Let the dark hollow it out, and forget about evil —</span>
                <span class="line">Doesn't and never – and 'let go of tomorrow, and me with it.'</span>
                <span class="line">O the days were longer and richer when they weren't full of duty</span>
                <span class="line">I know and could be again —</span>
                <span class="line">Tonight you and I and the bodiless Sibyl will experiment again.</span>
                <span class="line">Who hasn't stepped into an endless tomorrow, or</span>
                <span class="line">Seen the end of things? She sees it every morning.</span>
                <span class="line">It is all she sees. What will remain, after her light and voice,</span>
                <span class="line">When even that has rotted through? Nothing but that vision —</span>
                <span class="line">Of the future — pushing their synchronicity ever back,</span>
                <span class="line">The first of that new, paradoxical sort of revelation, inhibiting its own truth.</span>
                <span class="line">Why don't you just lie, Sibyl, ask I and the interjector, and see something else?</span>
                <span class="line">But she and I are voiceless now</span>
                <span class="line">And there is only the— the other whose name I have forgotten.</span>
