            "But Nature, though we mark her not,<br>
            Will take away — may cease to give."
            <cite>Dorothy Wordsworth, <em>Floating Island</em></cite>
        </div>

        <p class="poem-note">In the last decade of his life, Hegel presented a series of lectures which, posthumously, would be published as <em>Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion</em> (1832). In it, he ranks religions according to their relationship to the sublime. The basest of belief systems, in his conception not worthy of being called religion, is sorcery and magic, a system which in his view characterises the cultures of Native North Americans, Mongolia, and much of Africa, et al. He speaks in the triumphant latter decades of the Romance era, when the dominant artistic project in Europe was the depiction of the sublime and the use of nature – or environment – to gesture theretoward. To recognise, be invigorated, and in all freed by the sublime requires that one conceive of nature as sympathetic, as having given freedom as a gift, personally, to you. Only Christianity, in his thought, achieves this relation, and so it is the final, revelatory religion. Magic's great flaw is that it assigns to the human agent alone the responsibility, and the assumed ability, to control and manage nature, where in truth only God can do that, and in truth when you are sick, when black spots foul the red of your gums, when bones contort upon themselves, and migraines sing so bright there is no good darkness to seal oneself in except death, then what better prescription than a walk among the reaves and the full, fresh air of God's universe? All pain will be consoled in the sublime. As an experiment, for whatever reason, though, this poem tells a story about travelling or perhaps falling from the great, great heights of proximity-to-the-sublime, down the rungs of Hegel's religious hierarchy, to the depths of magic. The journey is a lot of work, but perhaps it does something useful.</p>
